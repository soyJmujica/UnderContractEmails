<strong>Hi there!</strong>
We would like to introduce ourselves.   We are the Transaction Coordinators for The Military Veteran Team (FYI: We are multilingual in Spanish, Italian, Tagalog, & Portuguese.) Moving forward we will be your right-hand concierge service and will communicate with all parties as a team to ensure the many steps associated with your transaction and closing will be handled in a smooth and expeditious fashion.  
A key element to the closing process is meeting several contracted deadlines. The information listed below outlines the important dates that coincide with the contractual terms and obligations of the contract.  I have also CC'd several people who will help us with our closing.
